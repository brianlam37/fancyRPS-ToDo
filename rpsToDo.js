// This project introduces us to manipulating the HTML DOM with Javascript.

// With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.




//The HTML DOM allows JavaScript to change the content of HTML elements.


var losses = 0;
//TO DO: enter code to match 'losses' above for 'wins'

//YOUR CODE GOES HERE
//declare and set 'wins' variable to 0 below

var play = function(playerChoice) {

  //Start off by defining player, opponent, and results values as empty strings
  //None of these have a value yet, so they are defined as variables for the computer, but "points" are left blank until game play begins
  document.getElementById('player').innerHTML = '';
  //TO DO: enter code to match 'player' above for 'opponent' and 'results'
	
  //YOUR CODE GOES HERE 
  document.getElementById('opponent').innerHTML = '';
  document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = '';
	//The user makes their choice, which sets that value (rock, paper, or scissors) to 'player'  
	//This is our very first Javascript conditional statement!
	//A conditional statement is where a piece of code gets executed IF something is true. === means a value exactly matches the variable; || stands for "or"
	//The following conditional says:
	//"If the player chooses rock, OR chooses paper, OR chooses scissors, then show the player's choice on the page'
  if (playerChoice === 'rock' || playerChoice === 'paper' || playerChoice === 'scissors') {
    //When we get that element by the 'player' ID, the user's choice is then printed on the page. HTML + JS's 'document.getElementById' is how we get the value to display.
    document.getElementById('player').innerHTML = 'You chose' + ' ' + playerChoice + '.';

  } else {
    //If our page has a random option to choose, like "fire" we can throw an error
    document.getElementById('player').innerHTML = 'That is not a valid choice, try again.';
    return false;
  }
	
	//The computer's selection is set to a random number.  Math.random(); is calling a native Javascript function to provide the random number.  The rest of this function sets the value of the computer choice based on that number. They are broken up into "thirds" because we have three choices. We want to stop at 1/100th above the fraction, so that the computer includes .33 & .66 in the comparison
  var computerChoice = Math.random();
  //if .33 or less, choice will be rock
  if (computerChoice < 0.34) {
    computerChoice = 'rock';
  //
  //**HINT: the way to combined two conditional arguments in javascript is with &&:
  // if (peanutButter && jelly){
  //	 make sandwich;
  // } else if (peanutButter) {
  //	return 'No sandwich for you!';
  // }
  //
  //if less than or equal to .67 AND greater than .33, choice will be paper
  } else if (computerChoice <= 0.67 && computerChoice > 0.33) {
    //TO DO: set computer choice equal to paper here
    //YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    computerChoice = 'paper';
  
  //otherwise, choice will be scissors

  document.getElementById('opponent').innerHTML = '// Your opponent chose' + ' ' + computerChoice + '.';
